Everything has upheld its quality for the past 4 months of me eating here. There are always plenty of places to sit at including an outdoor patio. It's really nice to be able to see the chiefs as well preparing the food and you can visual see how fresh the food is. The cashier is very polite and sweet.

The burritos are huge and fill your burrito with everything. The super nachos hit the spot for your craving and once again generous in their portion. Nachos packed with asada, refried beans, cheese, pico, guac, sour cream and jalapeños. If you go in there's a salsa bar with unlimited homemade tortilla chips & salsa the pico and red salsa are the best - fresh ingredients and spicy. When you do to go order they always give complimentary chips and salsa too. \n\nService: I been in there once and the cashier was so nice. deciding if I should order more offered an open tab. The food came out so fast and warm. Everyone was great\n\nEnvironment: very clean inside and outside. The salsa bar was well kept and stocked up. Bathroom is also clean  \n\nOverall: I have dined in for late lunch and DoorDash them when I want a treat. Great local Mexican place. Compared to San Luis Taqueria, they can do better nachos so I go where when I want nachos and burritos",

The chicken fajitas were excellent and my husband who is super picky about his taco salads was extremely happy. The husband said the taco salad had the right amount of ingredients, not to much rice or beans, or a ridiculous amount of lettuce to fill the bowl.\n\nDay 2 I ordered the Chile Verde and the husband again had the taco salad. Again, the taco salad was excellent, and holy moly, my Chile Verde was so good! The flavors were superb! I could not stop raving about how good the Chile Verde was and at one point I was practically slurping up the sauce, it was that good!\n\nDefinitely check out Taqueria Santa Cruz Express if you are in the area, the food is worth the money!",

I've learned that students know where to get great food, large quantity.  \n\nSo we got on line.  I ordered the Taco Salad\nRice, beans, cheese, sour cream, guacamole, lettuce & choice of meat.\n$9.95.  I opted for the beef.  Also added a Modello.  The guy checking us out was exceptional.  He was friendly, informative and understood we had never been here before.  Rare that I find someone of this caliber working at a fast food Mexican joint.\n\nMy food was amazing.  The taco shell was warm, crisp and not greasy.  The beef was tender, well seasoned.  Everything in this salad was perfect.  At first I was thinking 4 stars.  Then I thought:  I got great fresh chips and dip to start - included, the service was amazing, the food was delicious.  The price?  Dirt cheap.  Was I happy?  I was 100% pleased.  Hence - 5 stars.\n\nWill I come here again?  Of course.  This is a great neighborhood joint for fresh authentic Mexican food.  My dinner came out quick and was perfect.",

The cuts of the meats are very flavorful and not dry. I've tried both the lengua and carne asada & they always give great portions so you will definitely get a bang for your buck. In addition to that, you get a side of chips and salsa.\n\nIf you're looking for Mexican food in SLO, this is the spot to go!",

I had two soft chicken tacos braised tinga style in two corn tortillas each. Which was necessary for the chicken in sauce very savory and with its own salsa on top.

We tried this place for the first time over the weekend and were pleased with our meal. We weren't too hungry so opted for a super burrito and 2 tacos (carne asada + carnitas) to be shared with 2 people. There's a salsa bar that's self-serve with plastic containers readily available. We definitely helped ourselves to it and tried all their salsa.\n\nOverall the foods were good, has some flavor but compared to the delicious Mexican foods in our area back home, the flavor is a just a tad bit lacking. The hot sauces weren't really spicy even though I tried both the mild and spicy ones. The carne asada super burrito was a good portion with guac, sour cream, and other deliciousness inside. The burrito has a tiny spicy kick to it that I loved. My fiance thought it was spicy and said his mouth was burning the whole meal. I honestly could barely feel the spice. The tacos were OK - meat was a bit dry and lacked some seasonings but drenched with hot sauce, they tasted good. We will definitely be back here and try their other items on the menu the next time we're in town!",

And believe me, I should know because a week doesn't go by without me eating  Mexican food!\n\nI couldn't decide what to have so I ordered the Carne en su Jugo, beef enchiladas and a goat meat taco. Everything was scrumptious! \n\nThe Carne en su Jugo is basically a deconstructed burrito in a broth with avocados and bacon but without the rice. The meat and beans were tasty and cooked perfectly.  I will definitely order this again!\n\nThe goat meat taco was outstanding. The meat was plentiful and, like the Carne Jugo, cooked perfectly. It was a juicy and full of flavor. This will be my go-to order item from now on. \n\nThe only thing I would change is the sauce for the enchilada plate. This sauce was kinda thick, which I'm not accustomed to. But the enchiladas were packed with meat and topped with cheese, which I am accustomed to and love. LOL. The beans and rice were also delicious! \n\nThis place gives you hearty portions and access to a delicious salsa bar. Their prices are great, especially considering the amount of food you get. I couldn't eat everything i ordered in one sitting. I actually got 3 meals out of it all. \n\nWhenever I'm in SLO, I'm heading to this place!",

There's a bunch of salsas and the pink one is really something if you like spice! \n\nWe wanted to try something new and ordered the Cal Poly burrito with the chile verde sauce, but it was alright; not bad, but nothing special. It's topped with a lot of sauce, cheese, and sour cream if you're looking for that. Tacos are $2.50 each and were just okay too. I'll stick with my regular order next time. \n\nOverall, there's a large menu, reasonable prices and quick service so we find ourselves coming back.",

It was one of the best burritos I've ever had and I would definitely come back. \n\nIt was super easy to order and grab a seat at the table. You get a little tray for chips and there's tons of different salsas (at varying degrees of spiciness) to try out. I got the California Veggie Burrito for my main meal. \n\nThe burrito was SO good. It has a perfect blend inside, and also these really fluffy potatoes which were so tasty. I tried it with the salsas and it was SO good. Overall, a great spot that's casual and has quick derived. I'll definitely be back when I find myself in SLO!",

It was a cold foggy day and I ordered the Carne e su Jugo, which is a soup with ground beef and bacon. That warmed my soul and I always think about it because I haven't been able to find it anywhere else.\n\nThis time, we were forced to take the 101 because of snow on the 5. We swung by here because I was craving this soup. It was the same--just as good and just as satisfying. The interiors have remained unchanged and the staff are still very friendly. With almost any order, they give you a little white platter to fill up on chips.\nChips and salsa are unlimited and self-served! There's no mild salsa if you're the type who can't handle spiciness, but the pico de gallo is pretty mild in my opinion.\n\nStreet parking only, which can be an issue at lunch or dinner hour. On a sunny day, it's great to dine on their patio. Definitely recommend coming here even if you're just passing by.",

They have classic mexican fare such as burritos, tacos etc. Whenever I come here, I typically order a few tacos or a California Burrito. Beware that the California Burrito that they whip up is far from what you will find in San Diego. Theirs contains rice, beans and other classic burrito fix-ins. I recommend going with the carnitas or carne asada meats. \n\nThey have a great salsa bar. The only downside is that the restaurant itself is pretty small so the salsa bar area can get pretty crammed. It can be quite the adventure gatherings your salsas.\n\nOverall this is a pretty tasty place to go, but you will certainly find better options in other cities.",

Looking forward to Tacos Dorados next time! They have a salsa bar, endless chips and a soda machine. I don't need anything else. Oh, if you're into it, they also have burritos, quesadillas and many other menu items. It's pretty clean and the guy at the register was super nice.",
